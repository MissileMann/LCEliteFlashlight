  - Edited the flashlight bulb to differentiate it more than the pro flashlight.
  - Added Light Utility as a soft requirement so that the headlamp light will be the elites light if you switch off of it.

- 1.0.2
  - The flashlight bulb will now be off (dark) from the start.
  - Hopefully fixed the flashlight off model sometimes reverting to blue.

- 1.0.1
  - Flashlight now has proper bulb part on the model that lights on and off
  - This in turn also fixes the issue where a flashlight would get stuck permanently on pointing up below your head when a mimic spawned that copied your appearance
  - Mimics should have the flashlight show up properly now with Flashlight Slot installed
